This is the repository for the Algorithm Design and Analysis course, as it was taught in the 6th semester of E.C.E. A.U.Th.. Unfortunately, this was a team project whose burden was carried only by individuals. What meant to be fun resulted in almost-missed deadlines due to the unwillingness of people to do what they signed up for. The names shown in the project are:
- Chatziioannou Lamprinos
- Evangelidis Nikolas
- Filippidis Foivos-Panagiotis

## Disclaimer
I'm pretty sure that the data in this repository is not what was actually submitted back when I took the course (for example, the pdf for project 2 was produced on the date of this repository's archival, to make sure that it was relatively complete) . I do not know why I forgot to update it back when that semester ended, but this repo is nearly all that is left from that course. There may even be a whole project missing, because I distinctly recall 3 deliverables.
